\section{Background}

%One advantage of studying theoretical seismology today is the availability of computer tools that we can use to explore equations and their solutions. Tools such as Matlab create new opportunities for deeper understanding – 
With the power of computing, we can investigate the nature of problems that have long been fundamental to the interpretation and understanding of seismograms. In these notes, I outline a Python solution for computing toroidal normal modes in radially symmetric earth models. To simplify the discussion, I work with simplest model: a uniform shell. This physical model is actually a surprisingly good approximation to earth at the longest periods of oscillation. Although earth has a very dense, mostly iron core, the fluid outer core results in a zero toroidal stress at the core-mantle boundary, much like the elastic shell model shown in \refFig{fig:shells}. To compute the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the model we must solve two problems. First, we must develop a tool to integrate two coupled first-order ordinary differential equations (ODE's), and second we must develop a tool to identify those values of frequency that produce a zero surface stress when the ODE's are integrated.

\subsection{Equations of motion}

A separation of variables solution to the homogeneous elastodynamic equations of motion results in three equations for the three space variables $(r, \theta, \phi)$. The longitudinal ($\phi$) equation is a simple second-order harmonic ordinary differential equation. The equation containing colatitude ($\theta$) reduces to a form of Legendre's equation with solutions that are the Associated Legendre functions. The equation in radius is a form of Bessel's equation, which has solutions in terms of spherical Bessel functions. Alternatively, Bessel's second order differential equation can be reduced to a set of first-order, coupled ODE's. Specifically, for the {\bf toroidal modes of a radially symmetric model}, the radial equations are equivalent to the
%eigenvalue problem
first-order coupled system of equations (see \refSec{sec:ODEs} for details)
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dr}
\left[ \begin{array}{c} W \\ T \end{array} \right]
=
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
\frac{1}{r} & \frac{1}{\mu(r)} \\
& \\
\frac{(l+2)(l-1)\mu(r)}{r^2}-\omega^2\rho(r) & \frac{-3}{r}
\end{array} \right]
\left[ \begin{array}{c} W \\ T \end{array} \right]
\label{ODEs}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{itemize}
\item $W(r)$ is the displacement
\item $T(r)$ is the stress
\item $\omega$ is the angular frequency
\item $\rho(r)$ is the density
\item $\mu(r)$ is the shear modulus
\item $l$ is the degree (or angular order)
\end{itemize}
%
%$W(r)$ and $T(r)$ are the displacement and the stress, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $\rho(r)$ is the density, $\mu(r)$ is the shear modulus, and $l$ is the
%angular order
%%radial order
%(a separation of variables constant).
For low frequencies and low
degree
%angular orders,
%radial orders,
$l$ these equations can be integrated numerically using a Runge-Kutta approach \citep[\eg][]{Press1988}.

Before you integrate \refEq{ODEs}, you must specify values of $l$, the density, the shear modulus, and the frequency $\omega$. Integration produces two functions of radius, $W(r)$ and $T(r)$. If the stress is zero at the top of the shell (earth surface) and the bottom of the shell (core--mantle boundary),
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{T}(a) &=& 0 \;\;\;\;\;\; {\rm top\;of\;shell}
\label{BC1}
\\
\hat{T}(b) &=& 0, \;\;\;\; {\rm bottom\;of\;shell}
\label{BC2}
\end{eqnarray}
%
then the assumed value of $\omega$ is an {\bf eigenfrequency} ($\omega^2$ is an {\bf eigenvalue}) and  $\hat{W}(r)$ and $\hat{T}(r)$ are {\bf eigenfunctions}.
(See note \footnote{The hat-notation for $\hat{T}(r)$ is to distinguish the eigenfunction, which satisfies the boundary condition (\refeqii{BC1}{BC2}) and \refEq{ODEs}, from the function $T(r)$, which only satisfies \refEq{ODEs}.} and note \footnote{These are not eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of \refEq{ODEs} but rather of the equation \citep[][Eq.~4.8-4.9]{DT}
%
\begin{equation*}
{\boldmath \cal H} \bs = \omega^2 \bs,
\end{equation*}
%
where ${\boldmath \cal H}$ is a linear operator with the eigensolution $\omega^2$ (eigenvalue) and $\bs$ (eigenfunction). It is best to think of {\em solution pairs} of $\omnl$ associated with functions $\Wnl(r)$ and $\Tnl(r)$.}.)
We don't know {\em a priori} the eigenfrequencies that satisfy the zero-stress boundary condition on the top and bottom of the shell. However, if we start the integration at the bottom of the shell ($r = b$), then we can guarantee that the stress at the bottom is zero by using initial values for the displacement and the stress equal to 1.0 and 0.0 respectively. The arbitrary amplitude of the displacement can be accommodated in normalization terms.

In general, there are an infinite number of frequencies that satisfy \refEq{ODEs} for each value of $l$. A systematic search must be performed to identify all the roots in a specific frequency range for a particular value of $l$. In essence, we must solve an equation that has the form
%
\begin{equation}
F(\omnl) = 0.
\end{equation}
%
The form of the function $F$ is described in \refEq{ODEs}, and we must solve those equations for the surface stress $\hat{T}(a)$ for each assumed value of $l$ and $n$. Finding solutions that have zero surface stress is a numerical root-finding problem: you assume a value of and integrate the equations to see if it produces zero stress at the outer surface.

\subsection{The numerical solution}

Our solution will involve three different Python scripts (\refFig{fig:workflow}); two are needed to solve the equations of motion (\refeq{ODEs}), and the third is used to find the values that are eigenfrequencies. The first two scripts handle the computation of the surface stress using the Runge-Kutta routines in Python (the surface-stress calculator). The third script repeatedly calls the surface-stress calculator as part of a simple root finding scheme that uses a fixed step size in frequency to identify regions containing the roots, and then relies on the Python root-finding routine \rfind\ to refine the value of the eigenfrequency. I describe each script in more detail below.
%, and conclude with some results for specific values of $l$.

\subsubsection{Computing the surface stress}

To integrate the equations and evaluate the surface traction I created two scripts. The first script (\tfilesdt) computes the stress and displacement derivatives using the differential equations (\refeq{ODEs}). The input arguments and return values of this script are of the special form required by the Runge-Kutta functions in Python, and the name of this script is an argument to the Python Runge-Kutta function. The first input argument is the independent variable of integration (radius for our problem), the second is a vector that contains the dependent variables in the coupled first-order differential equations (displacement and stress). $\mu$, $\rho$, $\omega$, and $l$ are all parameters of \tfiless\ and \tfilesdt\ so that they can be set and changed from the main script (\tfilemain). It's a good idea to keep this script as simple and short as you can, since it's executed often.

The second script (\tfiless) calculates the surface stress. For a given value of $\omega$, the function performs the computations needed to compute the stress and displacement eigenvectors. Note the brevity and simplicity of the two scripts used to solve \refEq{ODEs}. Since the Runge-Kutta routines are implemented in Python, we need only a two-line script to compute the derivatives and a one-line call to \sfind\ to integrate the equations. Once the integration is complete, we look up the surface stress (at $r = a = 6371$ km), which after execution is stored in the last element of array \verb+WT+.

\subsubsection{Finding the roots}

The third script (\tfilemain) implements a simple root-finding search and provides visual feedback on the process. You should have no trouble finding lucid descriptions of the ideas behind searching for roots, or zeros, of a function \citep[\eg][]{Press1988}. The basic idea in this script is to begin a search at a small value of frequency (I chose $f = 1/3600$, corresponding to a period of one hour) and march forward with a small step size ($\Delta f$), looking for steps that produce a change in sign of the surface stress estimate, $\hat{T}(a)$. If the sign of the surface stress changes then we know that we’ve bracketed at least one zero of the function. Of course we have to be careful, a step size too large may jump more than one root in one step. If we choose too small a value for $\Delta f$, then we spend much more time searching. More clever approaches are more appropriate when dealing with more complicated models. For this example I opted to use a small step size rather than getting too fancy with something adaptive.

Once I know two frequency values that bracket a root, I use the function \rfind\ to find that root; \rfind\ uses a bisection-interpolation procedure to find the root of the function.
% ZZZ the previous statement needs to be checked
You must pass the name of the script used to calculate the surface stress and the bounding values of frequency to the \rfind\ routine, and it returns the value of the root. Python allows you to control the options in the search for roots, but I found the default values suitable for this problem.

%\subsection*{The Uniform Shell Model}

%As mentioned earlier, the shell is a better approximation to earth than you might think. Approximate values of mantle parameters for PREM (Preliminary Reference Earth Model; \citet{PREM}) are 4380 kg/m and 5.93 km/s for the density and shear velocity respectively. We can compute the shear modulus using $\mu = \beta^2\rho$.

%Much of the third script is actually devoted to plotting the results. What do they look like? Figure 3 is a plot of the results of running the scripts described above after setting $l = 2$, and Figure 4 and Figure 5 are similar plots for $l = 25$, and $l = 100$, respectively. In each illustration, the eigenfrequency in millihertz and the eigenperiod (to the nearest minute) are listed in the subplot title. The blue line identifies the displacement eigenfunction, the red line the stress eigenfunction. Note that each of the stress eigenfunctions satisfies the zero-stress boundary conditions at the shell's inner (2891 km) and outer (6371 km) radii. You can count the number of nodes in the each displacement eigenfunction and see the integer increase in nodes associated with each higher mode; this is a consequence of the fact that we are solving a Sturm-Liouville problem \citep[][]{DT}. Table 1 is a list of the values with more precision than shown on the illustrations.

% NOTE: THESE NUMBERS ARE NOT CORRECT WITH THE MODIFIED RADIUS
%The $l = 2$ case includes the gravest toroidal mode $_0\ssT_2$. The uniform shell with mantle-like properties predicts a vibration of 0.3638~mHz, or approximately 2748~seconds, which is about 45.8 minutes. The value predicted by PREM is about 44.0 minutes, the value observed by \citet{Widmer1992toroidal} is 44.25 minutes (0.3766~mHz). That means the uniform shell is predicting the period in minutes to within about $3.5\%$.

%Observed eigenfrequencies: \citet{GD1975,PREM,Widmer1992toroidal}

\subsection{More from \cite{DT} on \refEq{ODEs}}
\label{sec:ODEs}

A derivation of \refEq{ODEs} is presented in \citet{DT}; our \refEq{ODEs} corresponds to their equations 8.114 and 8.115. As stated in \citet[][p.~270]{DT}, the traction $\bt$ exerted on any spherical surface is given in terms of the displacment scalars $U$, $V$, and $W$ by
%
\begin{equation}
\bt = \brh \cdot \bT = R\,\bP_{lm} + S\,\bB_{lm} + T\,\bC_{lm},
\end{equation}
%
where $\bT$ is the stress tensor and
%
\begin{eqnarray}
R(r) &=& (\kappa + \sfrac{4}{3}\mu)\frac{d U}{d r} + (\kappa - \sfrac{2}{3}\mu)r^{-1}(2 U(r) - k V(r))
\\
S(r) &=& \mu \left( \frac{d V}{d r} - r^{-1} V(r) + kr^{-1}U(r) \right)
\\
T(r) &=& \mu \left( \frac{d W}{d r} - r^{-1} W \right)
\label{Tr}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $k = \sqrt{l(l+1)}$ (\refTab{tab:waveparm}).

We see that the radial stress function $T(r)$ is defined in terms of the radial displacement function $W(r)$. (Note that \refEq{Tr} is the top equation in \refEq{ODEs}.) For toroidal motion, as in our problem, only $W(r)$ is non-zero while $U(r) = V(r) = 0$ (and therefore $R(r) = S(r) = 0$).

\section*{Problem 1 (4.0). Eigenfunctions, eigenfrequencies, and dispersion}

\begin{itemize}
\item A key point is to recognize that ``the mode'' \tnl{n}{l} has three parts:
%
\begin{equation}
\tnl{n}{l} \hspace{10pt} \left\{
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$\omnl$ & eigenfrequency \\
$\Wnl(r)$ & radial eigenfunction (related to $T(r)$) \\
$\Ynl(\phi,\theta)$ & surface spherical harmonic function
\end{tabular} \right.
\end{equation}
%
Our problem is not concerned with the surface displacement field\footnote{The surface displacent field is a vector field that is a function of $\Ynl(\phi,\theta)$; see \citet[][Section 8.6.1]{DT}.}.
So ``the mode'' or ``the solution'' \tnl{n}{l} (to \refeq{ODEs}) has three parts: an eigenfrequency $\omnl$ and two eigenfunctions, $W$ and $T$, with the boundary condition $T(a) = T(b) = 0$:
%
\begin{equation}
\tnl{n}{l} \hspace{10pt} \left\{
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$\omnl$  \\
$\Wnl(r)$ and $\Tnl(r)$ (see \refeq{Tr})
\end{tabular} \right.
\end{equation}
%

\item In this problem we will assume a homogeneous earth model with density $\rho = 4380$~kg/m$^3$ and shear modulus (rigidity) \makebox{$\mu = 1.54 \times 10^{11}$~Pa}. Before you proceed, make sure you follow the basic structure of the program.

\item How many crossings of $T(a) = 0$ are there within this set of 14 input frequencies?

\item List the eigenfrequency $_0f_2$ in mHz and eigenperiod $_0T_2$ in seconds and minutes. (Note \footnote{Notation might be confusing: $T$ is period, $T(r)$ is the stress eigenfunction (for toroidal modes), and \tnl{n}{l} is the label for a toroidal mode. Usually it should be clear from the context.})

\item Compare with the observed value in \refTab{tab:modes_obs}. What is the percent difference, $100\,\ln(T/T_{\rm obs})$, where $T$ is your computed eigenperiod for \tnl{0}{2}?

\label{Fm}

where $i$ is the measurement index that represents some particular $n$-$l$ pair, $f_i(\bem)$ is the predicted mode frequency, $f_i^{\rm obs}$ is the observed mode frequency, and $\bem$ is the model representing $\mu(r)$ and $\rho(r)$.

We will assume a fixed value of density ($\rho = 4380$~kg/m$^3$), and only look for different values of shear modulus over the range $\mu = [1.2\times 10^{11},\; 1.9 \times 10^{11}]$ Pa (hint: use a {\tt for} loop). It is best to think of our model vector as $\bem = (\rho, \mu)$.

Hint: For this misfit analysis, note that you only have observations up to $n = 3$ (\refTab{tab:modes_obs}).

\item List the value of $F(\bem)$ (\refeq{Fm}) for the best-fitting $\mu$.
\item Justify your choice of the new $\mu$, either in words, Python output, or a figure.
\item Show a dispersion plot as before (use \verb+plt.axis([0, 11, 0, 4])+) that contains all predictions and observations.

Here your predictions should be different from before, since your Earth model is now different (\ie different $\mu$). (You do not need to show the predictions from the original Earth $\mu$ model.)
\end{itemize}

\item (0.2) Repeat, but now use only the $N = 9$ observations for the fundamental mode ($n=0$) instead of $N=20$. (This means that some of the observations in your plot will not have been used in determining the new~$\mu$.)
{\bf For this $\mu$ value, show all predictions and all observations in your plot, not just the ones used in calculating the misfit.}

\item (0.3) Repeat, but now use only the observed eigenfrequency for \tnl{0}{2} ($N=1$) instead of $N=20$. (This means that all but one of the observations in your plot will not have been used in determining the new~$\mu$.)

\end{eqnarray*}
%
where $r=a$ is the surface and $r=b$ is the core-mantle boundary. (The values are an approximation to PREM's $\rho(r)$ and $\mu(r)$.) Thus, our Earth model $\bem$ can be thought of as having four parameters, the intercept and slope of $\rho(r)$ and $\mu(r)$: $\bem = (\rho_0,\rho_1,\mu_0,\mu_1)$.

Test your \tfileef\ for a few values of $r$ to make sure that the output values of $\rho$ and $\mu$ are sensible (no work needed).

%Note: As suggested in \verb+earthfun.m+, it may be helpful to use \verb+rspan+ as a global variable.

\begin{enumerate}
\item (0.4) Show your code for \tfileef.
\item (0.3) Generate a new dispersion plot with predictions and observations, as in Problem 1-\ref{prob:disp}.
\item (0.1) List the misfit in \refTab{tab:homo}.
\item (0.2) What parameters would you search over if you wanted to obtain an optimal linear earth model?
\end{enumerate}

%---------------

\item (0.5) \ptag\ {\bf Cubic earth.} Instead of using linear functions for $\rho(r)$ and $\mu(r)$, use the following cubic functions:
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\rho(r) &=& (-2.84710 \times 10^{-16})r^3 + (3.84976 \times 10^{-9})r^2 - (1.76479 \times 10^{-2})r + 3.24479 \times 10^{4}
\\
\mu(r) &=& (-8.11871 \times 10^{-9}) r^3 + (9.56717 \times 10^{-2})r^2 - (4.250608 \times 10^{5})r + 9.578569 \times 10^{11}
\end{eqnarray*}
%
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%\rho(r') &=& (-2.84710 \times 10^{-10})r'^3 + (3.84976 \times 10^{-6})r'^2 - (1.76479 \times 10^{-2})r' + 32.4479
%\\
%\mu(r') &=& (-8.11871) r'^3 + (9.56717 \times 10^4)r'^2 - (4.250608 \times 10^8)r' + 9.578569 \times 10^{11}
%\end{eqnarray*}
%
%where $r' = 1000r$ is in km.
This cubic function is a fit to the PREM profiles, so check that the numbers are sensible before moving on (no work needed).

\begin{enumerate}
\item (0.2) Show your code for the cubic function.
\item (0.2) Generate a new dispersion plot with predictions and observations, as in Problem~1-\ref{prob:disp}.
\item (0.1) List the misfit in \refTab{tab:homo}.
\end{enumerate}

\label{prob:earth_cubic}

%---------------
%
% HERE WE COULD GIVE THEM THE RHO COEFFICIENTS, THEN ASK THEM TO COMPUTE RHO(R) FOR PREM, THEN MU(R),
% SINCE THEY ALREADY HAVE VS(R)

%\item (0.0) {\bf PREM earth.} {\bf This problem is optional and will not be graded.} Instead of the cubic function, try using the exact function for PREM. You have a script for $\vs(r)$ from a previous homework; here you will need $\rho(r)$ and $\mu(r)$ instead.

\section*{Problem 3 (3.0). Phase speed and group speed}

For this problem we use the {\bf cubic model} and we consider the fundamental mode ($n=0$) only. In other words, $\fnl$ for $n > 0$ will not be needed. We are not using any observations (such as \refTab{tab:modes_obs}).

\begin{enumerate}
\item (0.5) Consider the set of $l$, \verb+lvec = np.arange(10,400,30)+. Using the expressions in \refTab{tab:waveparm}, make two dispersion plots for the fundamental mode:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item (0.2) frequency (mHz) vs degree

\item (0.3) phase speed (km/s) vs period; use the $x$ (period) limits \verb+[0 300]+

Qualitatively, how do these compare with the predictions for PREM, shown in \refFig{fig:dispersionApp}c?
\end{enumerate}

\item (0.3)
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Repeat Problem 1-\ref{prob:0T40_homo} for \tnl{0}{40} using the cubic model. List your values in \refTab{tab:eigfun}.
\item How has the cubic model affected the depth sensitivity \tnl{0}{40}, as indicated by the depth of the bulge in $W(r)$?
\item How has it affected the wavelength of \tnl{0}{40}?
\end{enumerate}

\label{prob:0T40_cubic}

%-------------

\item (0.0) In the next two parts, you will need to use discretized versions of $\rho(r)$ and $\mu(r)$. This discretization is already done within \tfiless. When you plot $W(r)$ and $T(r)$, you are using discretized versions of these functions, where \verb+rvec+ is the discretized radius values associated with the eigenfunctions.

Use the discretized radius \verb+rvec+ to compute discretized versions of $\mu(r)$ and $\rho(r)$. This can be done with the command
%
\begin{verbatim}
rhovec, muvec = earthfun(rvec, rspan, imod)
\end{verbatim}
%
if you have written \verb+earthfun+ to handle either an input vector or an input scalar.

%-------------

\item (1.0) Compute the group speed of \tnl{0}{40} using \citep[][Eq. 11.67]{DT}:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
U &=& \frac{I_2}{cI_1}
\label{group}
\\
I_1 &=& \int_0^a \rho(r) \left[W(r)\right]^2 r^2 \, \rmd r
\\
I_2 &=& \int_0^a \mu(r) \left[W(r)\right]^2 \rmd r
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $c$ is phase speed (\refTab{tab:waveparm}). % and expressions for $I_2$ and $I_1$ are in DT.
The phase speed $c$ and the group speed $U$ have units of rad/s. Multiplication by $a$ (earth radius) will give the group speed in km/s ($U' = Ua$).
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item (0.8) Show you lines of code.

Hint: For an adequate, crude numerical integration, use the command \verb+np.diff(rvec)+ to get a discretized vector of $dr$ that can be multiplied\footnote{Point-by-point multiplication assumes that the two vectors have the same length; you may need to remove or add a point to ensure this.} with the discretized version of $W(r)$. (Integration is summation.)

\item (0.2) List both $U$ and $U'$ in \refTab{tab:eigfun}.
\end{enumerate}
%Also, repeat the calculation for the original homogeneous model, and list your two values in  \refTab{tab:eigfun}.

\label{prob:0T40_cubic_group}

\item (1.0) Show numerically that each of the equations in \refeq{ODEs} is satisfied for \tnl{0}{40}: $_0W_{40}(r)$, $_0T_{40}(r)$, $_0\omega_{40}$.

Notes:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Again you will need the discretized versions of $\rho(r)$ and $\mu(r)$.

\item To check the solution, use the quantity \verb+np.linalg.norm(a - b)/np.linalg.norm(a)+ where \verb+a+ is the left-hand side and \verb+b+ is the right-hand side of \refEq{ODEs}. You want this value to be $< 10^{-3}$; you may need to lower the tolerance in the \sfind\ solver in \tfiless, which can be done by changing the \verb+max_step+ variable.

\item Use the command \verb+np.gradient(h,r)+ to obtain $dh/dr$ where \verb+h+ and \verb+r+ are equal-length vectors. This numerical approximation of $dh/dr$ will be good if \verb+r+ is densely sampled.
\end{itemize}

\item (0.2) \ptag\ How do the calculations of $_0f_{40}$ compare for with and without the lowered tolerance for the \sfind\ solver? 
Let $f_a$ denote the root obtained with the default numerical tolerance in \sfind. Let $f_b$ denote the root obtained with the lowered numerical tolerance. 
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item
List $f_a$ and $f_b$ in mHz.

Note: List the output with as many digits as you need to make the comparison.

\item Use $|\ln(f_a/f_b)|$ to quantify the difference between $f_a$ and $f_b$.

\item What does this imply about the accuracy of $\fnl$ relative to the accuracy of $\Wnl(r)$ and $\Tnl(r)$ in the numerical solutions?
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
