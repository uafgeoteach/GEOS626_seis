\subsection*{Overview and instructions}

This is a follow-up to the simple iterative Newton method example in \verb+lab_newton.pdf+. Be sure that you have done that exercise before beginning here.

Generalized least squares was introduced by Tarantola \citep{TarantolaValette1982quest,TarantolaValette1982nonlinear}; a comprehensive review can be found in \citet{Tarantola2005}, available as a pdf (note~\footnote{The author's website states: ``If you can not purchase the book, download it for free.''}). Generalized least squares is a Bayesian probabilistic inverse problem that assumes Gaussian uncertainties for model parameters and data.

Following \citet[][p.~205]{Tarantola2005}, the general form of a {\bf nonlinear least-squares misfit function} is
%\footnote{Here I am using $\cprior$ whereas Tarantola uses $\covm$.}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\misfitvar(\mvec) &=& \misfitvar_{\rm D}(\mvec) + \misfitvar_{\rm M}(\mvec) 
\\
&=& \hlf \left\| \bg(\mvec) - \dvec \right\|^2_{\rm D} + \hlf \left\| \mvec - \mprior \right\|^2_{\rm M}
\\
&=& \hlf \left( \bg(\mvec) - \dvec\right)^T \; \covdi \left( \bg(\mvec) - \dvec \right)
\;+\; \hlf \left( \mvec - \mprior \right)^T \; \cpriori \left( \mvec - \mprior \right).
\nonumber \\

\end{eqnarray}

\medskip\noindent
A Python solution to a least squares problem may be as simple as \verb+numpy.linalg.solve(G,d)+ or \verb+numpy.linalg.pinv(G)@d+, but what is the meaning (and computation) behind these expressions? The objective of this assignment is to demystify some of the black-box elements of least-squares inverse problems. This will involve a combination of reading \citet{Tarantola2005}, solving some equations, and implementing the equations within Jupyter Notebook. We approach these topics with the classic example of earthquake location.

% comment out for 627:
See \citet[][Chapter 7]{SteinWysession} for an introduction to the earthquake location problem. However, note that they do not approach the problem from a generalized least squares perspective, as we do in this assignment. In particular, they do not consider the model misfit term $(\mvec-\mprior)^T \cpriori (\mvec-\mprior)$. But they do introduce the concept of the data covariance matrix and posterior model covariance matrix on p. 421.

Throughout the assignment, and in the code, keep in mind the interchangability of these terms:
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mpost &=& \mvec_{\rm final}
\\
\mtarget &=& \mvec_{\rm true}
\end{eqnarray*}
%
The posterior model is the same as the final model of an iterative problem. And the ``target model'' is the same as the ``true model'': this is the model used to generate the ``target data'' or ``true data''. We will use the notation $\mpost$ and $\mtarget$.

\subsection*{Problem 0 (2.0). \ptag\ Generalized least squares solutions}

Here you will derive formulas for generalized least squares under the assumption of a linear model $\bg(\mvec) = \bG\mvec$.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item (1.5) Show the equivalence of the three expressions for the posterior Gaussian that are listed in \citet[][p.~66]{Tarantola2005}:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\mpost &=& \left(\bG^{\tssT} \covdi \bG + \cpriori \right)^{-1}
\left( \bG^{\tssT} \covdi \bd + \cpriori\mprior \right)
\label{mpost1}
\\
&=& \mprior + \left(\bG^{\tssT} \covdi \bG + \cpriori \right)^{-1} \bG^{\tssT} \covdi \left( \bd - \bG \mprior\right)
\label{mpost2}
\\
&=& \mprior + \cprior \bG^{\tssT} \left( \bG \cprior \bG^{\tssT} + \Cd\right)^{-1} \left( \bd - \bG \mprior\right)
\label{mpost3}
\end{eqnarray}
%
HINT: You may find it useful to use the two matrix identities in \citet[][Eq.~6.525]{Tarantola2005} (which are serived in \verb+notes_tarantola.pdf+), as well as the expressions for the posterior covariance,
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\cpost &=& \left(\bG^{\tssT} \covdi \bG + \cpriori \right)^{-1}
\label{cpost1}
\\
&=& \cprior - \cprior \bG^{\tssT} \left( \bG \cprior \bG^{\tssT} + \covd \right)^{-1} \bG \cprior
\label{cpost2}
\end{eqnarray}

\item (0.5) List each matrix in \refEqab{mpost1}{cpost2} that must be inverted. Also list the dimensions of each matrix, assuming that there are $\nparm$ model parameters and $\ndata$ observations.
\end{enumerate}

%------------------------

\subsection*{Problem 1 (2.0). Earthquake location: theory}

\begin{enumerate}
\item (0.5) Derive an equation for the arrival time $t_r$ of a seismic wave that originates at source location ($x_s, y_s$) at origin time $t_s$ and is recorded at receiver location ($x_r, y_r$). Assume that the medium is homogeneous and characterized with a single wavespeed $V$.

\item (0.3) Let $t_r = g(\mvec)$, where $\mvec = (x_s,y_s,t_s,V)$.
Is $g$ a linear function of $t_s$? Is it a linear function of $x_s$, $y_s$, or $V$?
Is it a linear function of $\mvec$?

\item (0.2) Apply the variable transformation $v = \ln(V/V_0)$, where $V_0$ is a normalizing constant such that $v$ is unitless. Write $g(\mvec)$ in terms of the model parameters $x_s$, $y_s$, $t_s$, and $v$.

\item (0.8) Write expressions for the partial derivatives of $g(\mvec)$: $\partial g/ \partial x_s$, $\partial g/ \partial y_s$, etc.

\item (0.0) What is the dimension of the matrix of partial derivatives $\bG$, represented by
%
\begin{equation}
G_{ik} = \partial g_i/ \partial m_k
\end{equation}
%
where $i$ is the receiver (or arrival time) index. (Here the subscript $i$ for data index and $r$ for receiver index are the same, since there is one measurement per receiver.)

\item (0.2) Write the matrix-schematic form for $G_{ik}$. Do not write out the full expressions.
For example, the upper left entry of your matrix should be $\partial g_1/\partial x_s$.
Use $\cdots$ to indicate an entry within a sequence.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Problem 2 (1.0). Earthquake location: understanding the code}

\begin{itemize}
\item Be sure you have done Problem 1 before starting this problem.

\item I have provided a set of Python notebooks to get you started on this problem. {\bf Do not change any of the user parameters until you have finished these questions. The questions depend on the default settings, as given.}

\item Note: Generating samples (from $\cprior$ and $\covd$) is not required to solve this problem. We use the samples mainly to ``illuminate'' the covariance matrices.

\item It may help to relate this problem to a real-world example of earthquake location. Imagine that you detect a P wave at some particular station (``station X''). The next closest station, which has not yet ``seen'' the P wave, is 20~km away. At that moment you might assume a prior model for the epicenter $(x_s, y_s)$ that is centered on station X and has a Gaussian distribution characterized by $\sigma = 20$~km. 
Your {\bf prior model} for the structure of the medium is assumed to be homogeneous with P-velocity reference value $V = 5$~km/s (with some associated uncertainty). Your prior model for the origin time could be the arrival time at station X (with some associated uncertainty).

You then record the P wave arrival times at all other stations. You choose an {\bf initial model}; a sensible choice might be the prior model (see above). With this initial model, you compute predicted arrival times at all stations. Using the generalized least-squares misfit function (see Overview and instructions), you quantify the misfit between your predicted arrival times and the observed arrival times. The rest is optimization.

\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item (0.5)
Run \tfile.
%\footnote{You do not need to enter any value at the prompt. If you hit ``0'' and hit return, then it will exit. If you hit any non-zero number and hit return, you will see an error message.}
You should generate six figures, one of which is \refFig{fig:srcrec}. Then the code will crash because some code still needs to be written.

Examine \tfile\ and \tfileFE\ to see what is being plotted in these figures. Answer the following questions ``in words,'' that is, without excerpts from the code.

\begin{enumerate}
\item (0.0) In the code, how is the prior model and the prior model covariance matrix determined?

\vspace{1cm}

\item (0.1) Explain how the initial model and target model are determined (in the hypothetical case that \verb+irandom_initial_model=1+ and \verb+irandom_target_model=1+.)

\begin{itemize}
\item initial model
\item target model
\end{itemize}

\item (0.2) Explain what the ``observations'' are and how they are generated.

\vspace{1cm}

\item (0.2) What do the functions \verb+tt+, \verb+d+, \verb+G+, and \verb+S+ do? Put your responses in \refTab{tab:funs}.

\item (0.0) What are the two main reasons for generating samples of $\cprior$?

\vspace{1cm}

\end{enumerate}

%------------------


\item (0.4) 

\begin{enumerate}
\item (0.0) Write down the quasi-Newton algorithm from \citet[][Eq.~6.319]{Tarantola2005}\footnote{Tarantola calls this the Newton aglorithm, but right before this, he states that he's using ``the (usual approximation of the) Hessian'' that does not include second derivatives of the forward model. This makes it the quasi-Newton algorithm. Also known as the Gauss-Newton algorithm.}. Use $\nu_n = 1$, use $\cprior$ instead of $\covm$, and use $\bd_n = \bg(\mvec_n)$ to represent the predictions of the forward model.

\vspace{1cm}

\item (0.1) Complete \refTab{tab:vars}.

\item (0.1) Compare Eq.~6.319 with Eq.~6.291,
%
\begin{equation}
\mvec_{n+1} \approx \mvec_{n} - \bHh^{-1}_n \bgammah_n.
\label{mn}
\end{equation}
%
What are the equations for $\bgammah$ and $\bHh$?

\vspace{1cm}

\item (0.1) Rewrite \refEq{mn} in terms of $\bgamma$ and $\bH$ instead of $\bgammah$ and $\bHh$. \\ (See \verb+notes_tarantola.pdf+)

\vspace{1cm}

\item (0.1) List full expressions for $\bH$ and $\bgamma$ (no hat-notation should appear). These are what you will be coding in the lab.

\vspace{1cm}

\item (0.1) From Section 3.2.3, what is the equation for $\cpost$?
