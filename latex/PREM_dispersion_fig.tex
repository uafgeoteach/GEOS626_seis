\caption[Dispersion of surface waves]
{{
Dispersion of surface waves, plotted as phase velocity $c(T)$ and group velocity $U(T)$. The curves are calculated using normal-modes summation with the 1D earth model PREM \citep{PREM}; each point corresponds to a normal mode with harmonic degree~$l$. A couple points are labeled in A. These curves are for the fundamental spheroidal (Rayleigh) and toroidal (Love) modes ($n = 0$); dispersion curves of overtone branches ($n \ge 1$)  can be seen in Figures 11.5 and 11.6 of \citet{DT}.
{\bf A.}~Phase velocity dispersion $c(T)$. Gray box shows region of C.
{\bf B.}~Group velocity dispersion $U(T)$. Gray box shows region of D.
{\bf C-D.}~Same as A-B, only with different axes ranges.
With periods $T<300$s, Love waves travel faster than Rayleigh waves.
